# scythe

`scythe` is a basic API for drawing two-dimensional graphics. It provides the `Drawable` trait, which is an abstraction over the possible drawing operations. It also provides the `Canvas` type, which wraps around an implementation of `Drawable` and provides a higher-level API for drawing.
